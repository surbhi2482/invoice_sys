invoice_pricing.py

Single concept: invoice pricing (subtotal -> discount -> tax -> total).

Highlights for 'Software Construction':
- One abstract concept per file (pricing).
- Useful comments document intent and contracts (not obvious code).
- No magic literals: use named constants (TAX_RATE, MAX_DISCOUNT_PCT).
- LSP: DiscountPolicy contract + PercentageDiscountPolicy subclass preserves it.
- Error handling: validate inputs, raise precise exceptions, resource-safety not needed here.
- Defensive semantics: pre/postconditions, immutability (frozen dataclass), exhaustive match.
